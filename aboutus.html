							<p>Founded by a couple of University of Waterloo students in Canada, we were tired of great local businesses needing to take a huge cut of their revenue to put out ads online and in the newspaper. We saw that businesses from all levels and industries struggled with getting their names out there. Whether you're a local restaurant who wants more traffic or a mobile app that needs more signups, we want to help you get the word out quickly, effectively and cheaply. Helping businesses grow. That's our goal. </p>
							<p>For our drivers, we knew that owning a car is tough. Driving a car is expensive. You have to worry about insurance, maintenance, gas and everything in between. Like most people, we dread the sight of increasing gas prices so we decided to use Goose as a way to offset those costs. Driving with Goose allows everyone to make passive income - that is income earned through doing zero to minimal work. You're busy with life and work. We want Goose to help.</p>
							<p>The point of Goose is to make everyone winners. Our business partners get effective and affordable advertising and our drivers get more cash in their wallet. It's pretty simple and we want to keep it that way.</p>
